  Hi there, this a project I've worked on in Unity using C#. It was made from scratch, including the graphics, realised in Photoshop and it is a puzzle style game. It follows the adventure of a little girl lost in a dream world, actually a nightmare world, where all her fears come true. She is fighting to go forward and pass all the obstacles and regain the light which symbolizes the morning. 
    The game's style is black and white and the characters are designed in form of a shadow.
